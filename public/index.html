		<div class="about-text">Ha Thu is a yoga and meditation teacher based in Tokyo and Toronto. Thu is dedicated
			to

		<div class="about-title">journey to the within</div>
		<div class="about-text">As a natural seeker, in the middle of family and personal crisis,
			I found myself at my first yoga class, yet the postures and savasana at the end gave me a deep sense of
			releasing, grounding
			and the feeling of coming home to myself.
			This is when yoga became the beginning of a life long journey for me. <br>
			I am devoted to continuously­­ learning, sharing this knowledge for everyone to bring in more joy and
			peace into ourlives.
			The more I explore and teach, the more I am able to gain new wisdom from my students. I am deeply
			grateful to share this journey with each soul I come across in my life.
		</div>

		<div class="about-title">a rich practice</div>
		<div class="about-text">My teachings are grounded in the traditional lineage of Hatha Yoga married with the
			movement of Vinyasa Flow.
			I also make effort to merge the wisdom from philosophy of Buddhism into simple meditation practice that
			everyone can access. Making the time spending on our Yoga mat become the most precious present we give to ourselves.<br> <br>
			I hope for each student to experience a journey that goes beyond the body and touches deeply into the
			heart
			by weaving together asana, mantra, mudra, pranayama, meditation, along with a deep connection with
			nature.
			I am passionate about the benefits for all, and believe the rituals of the physical practice of yoga and
			meditation within our daily routines could serve to regain our natural state of health and well-being –
			empowering and equipping you with the means to live a more vibrant life.

							<p>Every time I join Thu's class, I have a chance to purify my energy, my mind and my soul.
								This yoga class helps me leave all the distractions behind and only focus on my
								happiness and my well-being.
								Thu is a passionate yoga teacher. She lets us try many different positions and
								approaches so there is no class with the same flow or content. Through yoga, Thu lends
								us a hand to reconnect with the Mother Nature, to absorb all the cleanest energies. At
								the end of the day, all we want in life is health, happiness and peace in mind.</p>

							<p>I really love her yoga style! She has a deep knowledge and her flows are just amazing..
								very detailed (breath, position, where to look etc) and can flow deeply inside all the
								position! Can feel her kindness and warmth as soon as she starts to speak and starts the
								meditation or mantras</p>

							<p>Monday morning, I feel so sore all my arms and legs, tried to remind what did I do the
								day before! Yeah, right! I had a Yoga class with Thu! This is gooooood, I want to take
								it again.
								Just tried to tell you how I love about Ha Thu’s class, it’s hard core, it helps me to
								do the right pose, and it’s not just all about Yoga. Through Ha Thu’s Yoga, I got my
								good energy collected and stayed with me the whole day. Will try to get this activity as
								one of my habits and have a healthier better life. My invitation for you to try and feel
								it!</p>
